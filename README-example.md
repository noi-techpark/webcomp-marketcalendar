## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- ToDo: Check the prerequisites
- Node 12 / NPM 6

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment) section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
ToDo: git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/project-name.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
ToDo: cd project-name/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Tests and linting

The tests and the linting can be executed with the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run with docker

You can access the webcomponent running in a docker container. For accessing the webcomponent in the browser you will need a server (e.g. webpack dev-server) that is hosting a page which includes the webcomponent tag, as well as the script defining it.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Start the docker containers
- Create a .env file: <br>
  `cp .env.example .env`
- [Optional] Adjust port numbers in .env if they have conflicts with services already running on your machine
- Start the container with: <br>
  `docker-compose up -d`
- Wait until the container is running. You can check the current state with: <br>
  `docker-compose logs --tail 500 -f`
- Access webcomponent running in docker in your browser on: <br>
  `localhost:8998`

### Stop the docker containers
- `docker-compose stop`

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
